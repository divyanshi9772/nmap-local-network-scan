1. Install Nmap from Official Website
* from: https://nmap.org/download.html
* Downloaded the appropriate version for my OS (Windows Installer)
* Installed it with default settings (includes a GUI version called Zenmap, but we're using CMD).

2. Find Your Local IP Range
Using ipconfig, I found my IP details:
* IPv4 Address: 192.168.29.153
* Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
? This means my local IP range is:
192.168.29.0/24
This range includes all 256 devices (from .1 to .254) that could be on my Wi-Fi.

3. Run Nmap TCP SYN Scan
Open Command Prompt, and run:
nmap -sS 192.168.29.0/24
This performs a stealthy TCP SYN scan of all devices in network, checking for open ports.

4. Note Down IP Addresses and Open Ports Found
The scan discovered 4 active devices:
 192.168.29.1 ? (Router - Reliance Jio)
Open Ports:
* 80/tcp ? HTTP
* 443/tcp ? HTTPS
* 8080/tcp ? HTTP Proxy
* 8200/tcp ? Trivnet1 (custom)
* 8443/tcp ? HTTPS-alt
* 7000/tcp, 7443/tcp ? Oracle services
 192.168.29.21 ? (Realme Mobile)
* All ports closed 
192.168.29.24 ? (Smart Device - Earda)
* 2869/tcp ? ICSLAP (UPnP related)
 192.168.29.153 ? (My PC)
Open Ports:
* 135/tcp ? MSRPC
* 139/tcp ? NetBIOS
* 445/tcp ? Microsoft-DS
* 1521/tcp ? Oracle DB Listener
* 8080/tcp ? HTTP Proxy
* 903/tcp ? ISS console (possibly VMware)

5. Optionally Analyze with Wireshark (Skipped in my case)

6. Research Common Services Running on Those Ports

PortServiceDescription80HTTPUnsecured web service443HTTPSSecure web communication135MSRPCRemote procedure call (Windows system)139NetBIOSFile/printer sharing445Microsoft-DSSMB file sharing8080HTTP ProxyAlt HTTP port (sometimes used by devs)1521Oracle DBDatabase listener port2869ICSLAPPart of UPnP, media streaming

7. Identify Potential Security Risks from Open Ports
 My PC (192.168.29.153) Security Risks:
* 135/139/445: High risk - commonly exploited in ransomware and malware.
* 1521: Sensitive Oracle DB port - should be closed if not in use.
* 8080: Often targeted by bots - should be monitored or closed if unused.
* 903: VMware remote console - not needed unless running VMs.

I closed these ports using:
* Windows Firewall rules
* Disabling File and Printer Sharing
* Identifying & stopping background services.

8. Save Scan Results as a Text File
To save the scan:
nmap -sS 192.168.29.0/24 -oN scan_results.txt
This creates a text file named scan_results.txt in current CMD directory.
 I then uploaded this file to GitHub along with a report.md and README.md.

Outcome of the Task
* Learned to use Nmap to scan a local network
* Discovered active devices and their ports
* Understood how to research services
* Identified and closed risky ports
* Practiced network hardening
* Uploaded a clean report to GitHub
